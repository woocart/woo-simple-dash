Simple Dashboard for WooCommerce

== Description ==

WooDash creates a store-focused sidebar menu and home dashboard for easier access to the common WooCommerce features.

Instead of the unending sidebar menu of different plugin options, WooDash shows only the relevant buttons for a WooCommerce store.

- My Store
- Orders
- Stock
- Customers
- Products
- Taxes
- Reports
- Posts
- Pages
- Media
- Users

You can switch to the regular dashboard by clicking Switch Dashboard in the sidebar menu.

WooDash makes onboarding new clients to WooCommerce a lot easier and simplifies the store administration for the store managers.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire woodash folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

Switch to regular dashboard by clicking Switch Dashboard in the sidebar menu.
